This project started from a practical need: managing secure SSH access across multiple machines without the complexity and cost of enterprise solutions.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Why Another PAM Solution?\\n\\nCommercial PAM solutions like Teleport offer excellent features but come with licensing costs that can be prohibitive for smaller teams, homelabs, and organizations just starting their security journey. Orion-Belt provides a self-hosted alternative that covers the essential requirements:\\n\\n- Zero-trust architecture using reverse SSH tunnels\\n- Fine-grained access control with relationship-based permissions\\n- Complete session recording for audit and compliance\\n- Temporary access workflows with approval mechanisms\\n- Extensible plugin system for custom integrations\\n\\n## Architecture Decisions\\n\\nThe design prioritizes security and simplicity. Agents on target machines initiate outbound connections to the gateway, eliminating the need for inbound firewall rules. This reverse tunnel approach means your infrastructure remains unexposed even as you provide SSH access through the gateway.\\n\\nAccess control uses OpenFGA for relationship-based permissions, allowing natural expressions like \\"alice can access machine-32 as root\\" or \\"bob can access any machine in the production environment as the deploy user.\\"\\n\\n## Current Status\\n\\nVersion 0.2.0 is stable and running in production. The core functionality is complete:\\n\\n- Gateway server with SSH/SCP proxy and REST API\\n- Lightweight agents for Linux systems (Alpine, Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL)\\n- Custom client tools (osh for SSH, ocp for SCP)\\n- PostgreSQL backend for persistence\\n- Session recording with playback capability\\n\\nThe next major release (0.3.0) will add multi-factor authentication and SSH Certificate Authority support.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nInstallation takes about 10 minutes. The documentation covers setup for the gateway server, deploying agents, and configuring your first connection. Docker images are available, and installation scripts support multiple Linux distributions.\\n\\nCheck the [Quick Start guide](/docs/quickstart/installation) for detailed instructions.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nThe project is open for contributions. I\'m particularly interested in:\\n\\n- Testing on different Linux distributions\\n- Bug reports and use case feedback\\n- Documentation improvements\\n- Plugin development examples\\n\\nVisit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zrougamed/orion-belt) to get involved."},{"id":"reverse-ssh-tunneling-explained","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/reverse-ssh-tunneling-explained","editUrl":"https://github.com/zrougamed/orion-belt/tree/main/docs/blog/2026-01-08-reverse-ssh-tunneling-explained.md","source":"@site/blog/2026-01-08-reverse-ssh-tunneling-explained.md","title":"How Reverse SSH Tunneling Works in Orion-Belt","description":"One of the key features of Orion-Belt is its use of reverse SSH tunnels to establish connections.

This architectural choice eliminates the need for inbound firewall rules on target machines, but how does it actually work?\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Problem with Traditional SSH Access\\n\\nTraditional SSH requires opening port 22 (or another SSH port) on each target machine to accept incoming connections. This creates several challenges:\\n\\n- Firewall management becomes complex as the fleet grows\\n- Each exposed port is a potential attack surface\\n- Dynamic IPs and NAT complicate access\\n- Monitoring and logging are fragmented across machines\\n\\n## Reverse Tunneling Approach\\n\\nOrion-Belt inverts this model. Instead of clients connecting directly to target machines, the target machines connect outbound to the gateway server. When a user wants to SSH into a machine, the gateway routes the connection through the existing tunnel.\\n\\nHere\'s the flow:\\n\\n1. Agent on target machine establishes persistent SSH connection to gateway\\n2. Agent registers itself and maintains the connection\\n3. User authenticates with gateway and requests access to target\\n4. Gateway verifies permissions and routes SSH session through existing tunnel\\n5. User\'s session appears as a normal SSH connection to target machine\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\nThis architecture provides several advantages:\\n\\n**Security**: Target machines never listen for incoming connections. Only one component (the gateway) needs to be internet-accessible.\\n\\n**Simplicity**: No firewall rules needed on target machines. Just one outbound connection.\\n\\n**Observability**: All access flows through a single point, making audit logs comprehensive and consistent.\\n\\n**Flexibility**: Works behind NAT, with dynamic IPs, and across complex network topologies.\\n\\n## Implementation Details\\n\\nThe agent uses Go\'s `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` package to create the reverse tunnel. The connection includes automatic reconnection logic and heartbeat mechanisms to maintain connectivity.\\n\\nOn the gateway side, the SSH proxy maintains a registry of active tunnels and routes incoming user sessions to the appropriate agent connection. Session data passes through the gateway, enabling real-time monitoring and recording without compromising end-to-end encryption of the SSH protocol itself.\\n\\n## Trade-offs\\n\\nThis approach does introduce a single point of failure (the gateway), which is why high availability features are planned for v1.0. The gateway must also handle the multiplexing of potentially hundreds of concurrent sessions, requiring careful resource management.\\n\\nFor most deployments, these trade-offs are acceptable given the security and operational benefits."},{"id":"managing-homelab-access","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/managing-homelab-access","editUrl":"https://github.com/zrougamed/orion-belt/tree/main/docs/blog/2026-01-05-managing-homelab-access.md","source":"@site/blog/2026-01-05-managing-homelab-access.md","title":"Using Orion-Belt to Manage Homelab Access","description":"Managing SSH access for a homelab presents unique challenges.

You want secure remote access without exposing services directly to the internet, but you also don\'t want the complexity of enterprise solutions. Here\'s how Orion-Belt fits this use case.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Homelab Access Problem\\n\\nA typical homelab might include:\\n\\n- Multiple servers running different services\\n- Virtual machines for testing and development\\n- Network equipment requiring CLI access\\n- Raspberry Pis and other IoT devices\\n\\nYou need SSH access to all of these from outside your home network, but opening SSH ports to the internet is risky, and managing VPN access for every device becomes tedious.\\n\\n## Orion-Belt as a Solution\\n\\nWith Orion-Belt, you deploy the gateway server as your single internet-facing access point. This can run on a small VPS or even within your homelab behind a reverse proxy.\\n\\nEach device in your homelab runs the lightweight Orion-Belt agent, which connects outbound to the gateway. No inbound ports needed on your home network except for the gateway itself.\\n\\n## Example Setup\\n\\nFor a homelab with 5 machines:\\n```bash\\n# Gateway on VPS (Ubuntu 22.04)\\n./install-gateway.sh\\n\\n# Agent on each homelab machine\\ncurl -sSL https://orion-belt.pages.dev/install-agent.sh | bash\\n```\\n\\nThe installation scripts handle service creation, database setup, and initial configuration. Within 10 minutes, you have a working PAM system.\\n\\n## Access Control\\n\\nYou can create different permission levels:\\n\\n- Full admin access to all machines\\n- Limited access for family members (maybe just the media server)\\n- Temporary access for friends helping with projects\\n\\nThe permission system uses natural language patterns:\\n```bash\\n# Grant yourself admin access everywhere\\norion-belt grant-permission --user admin --machine \\"*\\" --remote-user root\\n\\n# Give your friend temporary access to the test server\\norion-belt grant-permission --user friend --machine test-01 --remote-user deploy --expires 24h\\n```\\n\\n## Session Recording\\n\\nEvery SSH session is recorded automatically. This is useful for:\\n\\n- Reviewing commands you ran during troubleshooting\\n- Security audit if something goes wrong\\n- Learning from others\' sessions (great for homelab collaboration)\\n\\nSessions can be played back directly from the web interface or downloaded as text logs.\\n\\n## Resource Usage\\n\\nThe gateway requires minimal resources (1 CPU, 1GB RAM, 10GB storage is plenty). Agents use about 5MB of memory and negligible CPU. For a typical homelab, the entire system runs comfortably on a $5/month VPS.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nThe [Homelab Setup Guide](/docs/use-cases/homelab) covers the complete installation process with specific examples for common homelab configurations."},{"id":"open-sourcing-orion-belt","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/open-sourcing-orion-belt","editUrl":"https://github.com/zrougamed/orion-belt/tree/main/docs/blog/2025-12-31-open-sourcing-orion-belt.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-12-31-open-sourcing-orion-belt.md","title":"Orion-Belt is Now Open Source","description":"Today marks an important milestone for Orion-Belt.

After several months of private development and testing, the project is now publicly available on GitHub.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## From Private to Public\\n\\nOrion-Belt started as a personal project to solve a specific problem: managing secure SSH access across multiple machines without enterprise-level complexity or cost. The initial development happened in a private repository where I could experiment freely, make mistakes, and iterate on the architecture without worrying about maintaining a clean commit history for public consumption.\\n\\nThe system has been running in production environments since October, handling real workloads and proving its reliability. That production experience informed numerous design decisions and helped identify edge cases that wouldn\'t have been obvious from theoretical planning alone.\\n\\n## Preparing for Release\\n\\nMoving from private development to open source required more than just flipping a repository to public. The codebase needed preparation:\\n\\n- Cleaned up experimental code and dead-end implementations\\n- Organized the commit history : mess to Initial commit ...\\n- Created comprehensive documentation covering installation, configuration, and architecture\\n- Wrote contribution guidelines and code of conduct\\n- Set up issue templates and CI/CD workflows\\n- Removed any hardcoded credentials or environment-specific configurations\\n\\nThe goal was to present a codebase that\'s production-ready and approachable for contributors. Someone cloning the repository should be able to understand the system architecture, run the tests, and deploy a working instance without needing to reverse-engineer undocumented decisions.\\n\\n## What\'s Available\\n\\nThe public repository includes:\\n\\n- Complete source code for gateway server, agent, and client tools\\n- Docker configurations and deployment scripts\\n- Installation guides for major Linux distributions  \\n- OpenAPI specification and interactive documentation\\n- Comprehensive test suite\\n- Architecture diagrams and technical documentation\\n\\n\\n## Looking for Contributors\\n\\nOpen sourcing isn\'t just about making code available. It\'s about building a community around shared needs. I\'m particularly interested in contributions from people who:\\n\\n- Run homelabs or self-hosted infrastructure\\n- Manage SSH access for small to medium-sized deployments\\n- Have experience with PAM systems and can provide architectural feedback\\n- Want to add integrations with tools they already use\\n- Can test on platforms and distributions I don\'t have access to\\n\\nThe project is stable and functional, but there\'s substantial room for improvement. The roadmap includes MFA support, certificate-based authentication, high availability features, and better observability tools. These are all areas where community input would be valuable.\\n\\n## Getting Involved\\n\\nThe [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zrougamed/orion-belt) is the central hub for development. Start with the documentation to understand the system, try deploying it in your environment, and open issues for bugs or feature requests.\\n\\nIf you\'re interested in contributing code, check the issue tracker for tasks tagged as \\"good first issue\\" or \\"help wanted\\". The contribution guidelines explain the development workflow and testing requirements.\\n\\nFor questions or discussions that don\'t fit GitHub issues, there\'s a discussions board where you can ask about use cases, architecture decisions, or deployment strategies.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nThe immediate focus is on improving documentation based on feedback from new users and fixing any issues that emerge as more people deploy the system in different environments.\\n\\nVersion 0.3.0 development has already started, focusing on MFA integration and SSH certificate authority support. \\n\\nThe project is now in your hands as much as mine. Looking forward to seeing where the community takes it."}]}}')}}]);
