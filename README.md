# Orion-Belt

**Orion-Belt** is an open-source, secure SSH/SCP bastion system designed for **controlled access to infrastructure without exposing networks**.

It provides **reverse SSH tunneling**, **relationship-based access control (ReBAC)**, **temporary access workflows**, and **full session recording**, making it ideal for teams that need **auditable, time-bound, and approval-based access** to servers behind firewalls.

Think of it as a lightweight, self-hosted alternative to traditional bastion hosts or commercial access gateways — built with simplicity, auditability, and extensibility in mind.

> Status: **Alpha / Early development** (APIs and internals may change)

## Why Orion-Belt?

Traditional SSH and VPN-based access have limitations:

- Long-lived credentials
- No native approval workflow
- Limited auditability
- Broad network access instead of per-machine access

Orion-Belt solves this by:
- Eliminating inbound firewall rules using **reverse SSH tunnels**
- Enforcing **fine-grained, relationship-based access control**
- Supporting **temporary, approval-based access**
- Recording **every session for audit and replay**
- Acting as a single, centralized access gateway

## Orion-Belt in Action

![Orion-Belt demo](assets/orion-belt-in-action.gif)

## Features

- **Server Mode**: SSH/SCP tunneling server with session recording
- **Client Mode**: CLI tools (osh, ocp) for connecting to machines through the server
- **Agent Mode**: Runs on target machines to receive connections
- **ReBAC**: Relationship-based access control for authorized users
- **Temporary Access**: Request-based temporary access with admin approval
- **Session Recording**: Complete session recording and audit trails
- **Plugin System**: Extensible plugin architecture
- **Database Agnostic**: Interface-based database layer for easy switching

## Roadmap

Orion Belt is under active development with core functionality working in production. We have an ambitious roadmap ahead covering security hardening, advanced features, and multi-protocol support.

**Current Status:** Alpha v0.1 — Core SSH proxy, session recording, and access control are operational.

**What's Next:**
- Host key verification and API authentication (v0.2)
- High availability and identity provider integrations (v0.3)
- Risk-based access and command filtering (v0.4)
- Multi-protocol support: RDP, VNC, K8s, databases (v1.0)

See [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the complete development plan, outstanding TODOs, and contribution opportunities.

## Components

### Server
- SSH/SCP tunneling
- Session recording and playback
- ReBAC authorization engine
- Temporary access request handling
- Admin notification system

### Client (osh & ocp)
- `osh`: Orion-Belt SSH client
- `ocp`: Orion-Belt SCP client
- API integration with server

### Agent
- Runs on target machines
- Connects to server for reverse tunneling
- Receives and handles connections

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zrougamed/orion-belt.git
cd orion-belt

# Build all components
make build

# Or build individually
make build-server
make build-client
make build-agent
```

## Configuration

### Server Configuration
```yaml
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 2222
  ssh_host_key: "/etc/orion-belt/host_key"
  
database:
  driver: "postgres"
  connection_string: "postgres://user:pass@localhost/orionbelt"
  
recording:
  enabled: true
  storage_path: "/var/lib/orion-belt/recordings"
  
auth:
  rebac_enabled: true
  allow_temp_access: true
  
notifications:
  smtp_host: "smtp.example.com"
  smtp_port: 587
  from_email: "orion-belt@example.com"
```

### Client Configuration
```yaml
server:
  host: "orion-belt.example.com"
  port: 2222
  api_endpoint: "https://orion-belt.example.com/api"
  
auth:
  key_file: "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
```

### Agent Configuration
```yaml
server:
  host: "orion-belt.example.com"
  port: 2222
  
agent:
  name: "web-server-01"
  tags:
    - "production"
    - "web"
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server
```bash
orion-belt server --config /etc/orion-belt/server.yaml
```

### Starting an Agent
```bash
orion-belt agent --config /etc/orion-belt/agent.yaml
```

### Using the Client (osh)
```bash
# Connect to a machine
osh machine-name

# Request temporary access
osh --request-access machine-name --duration 1h --reason "Emergency deployment"
```

### Using the Client (ocp)
```bash
# Copy file to remote machine
ocp local-file machine-name:/remote/path

# Copy from remote machine
ocp machine-name:/remote/file local-path
```

### Building from Source
```bash
go mod download
go build -o bin/orion-belt ./cmd/server
```

### Creating Plugins
WIP: Plugin Development Guide

## Security Considerations

- All connections are encrypted using SSH protocol
- Session recordings are encrypted at rest
- ReBAC ensures fine-grained access control
- Audit logs track all access and changes
- Temporary access automatically expires

## Database Support

Currently supported databases:
- PostgreSQL

To switch databases, update the configuration and implement the `database.Store` interface if needed.
